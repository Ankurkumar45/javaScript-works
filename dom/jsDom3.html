        <p>A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations
            (computation) automatically. Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations
            known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a
            nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral
            equipment needed and used for full operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are
            linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.</p><br>
        <p>A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. Simple special-purpose
            devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots
            and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices
            like smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links billions of other computers and users.</p>
